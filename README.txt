Recipe Hero is the easiest way to add recipes to your WordPress site in seconds. Complete with countless features, food never tasted better.

== Description ==

It shouldn't be difficult to add a recipe to your WordPress site.

Recipe Hero adds a new custom post type, **recipe**, to your website. Adding a recipe is just like adding a post. You can add everything from the recipe's yield to the equipment needed, the cooking time to the ingredients - everything will be automatically formatted for Google Rich Snippets and Pinterest Rich Pins.

* **Docs @ [Recipe Hero HQ](http://recipehero.in/docs/)**
* **Extensions @ [Recipe Hero Extensions](http://recipehero.in/extensions/)**

Navigate to `http://yourwebsite.com/recipes` to see all the new recipes you've added. You can easily customise the CSS to your liking and make it look perfect. It's automatically set-up to be responsive, clean & beautiful.

== Usage ==

After creating your first recipe, you'll normally be able to go to: `http://yourwebsite.com/recipes/` to view an archive of all your recipes.

You can also visit **Recipe Hero > Settings** and choose a Recipe Page. This will turn the chosen page (created through **Pages > Add New**) into a recipe archive, showing all of your recipes. This is useful for then making that page your home page (in **Settings > Reading**).

There are also 2 shortcodes included with Recipe Hero:

* `[recipes]` - displays multiple recipes (see docs below)
* `[recipe]` - displays single recipe (see docs below)

**For more about displaying recipes, check out our [Displaying Recipes](http://recipehero.in/docs/displaying-recipes/) documentation.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I keep getting 404 Page Not Found errors when trying to view the recipes I've added! =

You need to re-save your permalinks first! Navigate to `http://yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php` and re-save your permalink settings.

= How do I remove the default Recipe Hero styling? =

Easy! Just add the code in the following gist to your theme's functions.php file: [Remove Styles Gist](https://gist.github.com/bryceadams/22439ae2efd3433ca29a)

= How can I translate the plugin? =

Just like you would translate any other plugin or theme! I've written [some documentation over here](http://captaintheme.com/docs/general/translating-a-theme-or-plugin/) that will help you get started.

Please feel free to [send me your translation](mailto:info@recipehero.in) afterwards so I can share it with other users, making Recipe Hero more accessible to everyone.

= Will Google recognise my recipes and show them like the other recipes in Google? =

Sure, but on food-steroids. Just check out the screenshots area.
